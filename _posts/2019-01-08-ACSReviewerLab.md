The American Chemical Society has recently released a course to shed insight into the review process for new reviewers.
This short course gives guidance on how to nativate tricky ethical situations, identify core criteria for evaluating manuscripts, and how to structure a review.
I went through the course and have reinforced many concepts as well as learned new things.

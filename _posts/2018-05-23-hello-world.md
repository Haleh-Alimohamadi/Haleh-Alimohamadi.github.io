Hello World! Welcome to my new personal website. Over the past weekend I took
on the task of building a new webpage. After some Google searching I stumbled
upon many nice webpages built using Jekyll Themes and hosted on GitHub.
Based upon the clean design and ease of customization, I decided to use the
[Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).
After lots of trial and error, I managed to wrangle the configuration into
something I'm happy with. Through this project I was introduced to many new
technologies including the `liquid` template language, `sass` compiled style
sheets, and `Jekyll` site generator among many others.

TL;DR, if you want to build a website I highly recommend checking out Jekyll
Themes such as Minimal Mistakes.

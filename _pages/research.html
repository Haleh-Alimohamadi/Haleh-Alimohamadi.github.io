 <h2>Mechanics of Biological Membranes</h2> 
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Biological phenomena in small length scales of nanometer are always fascinating.
One of the most compelling natural puzzles is the ability of cells to alter and adjust their shape so rapidly depending on the biophysical 
  and biochemical conditions. 
One key element of a cell's viability is the existence
of a self-assembled lipid bilayer known as the plasma membrane. From a mechanical point of view, plasma membrane is a continuous viscoelastic shell 
that bends and deforms in response to external stresses. To understand how molecular machineries can generate forces and deform cell membranes, I am developing theoretical
frameworks that can tightly integrate experimental observations with computational models.

<ul>
<li> <b>The Biconcave Morphology of Red Blood Cells </b></li>
</ul>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Human red blood cells have a unique donut (biconcave disk) shape. Deviations from this
biconcavity interfere with RBC function in fatal diseases such as anemias, sickle cell disease, and malaria. Building
upon our mathematical framework for membrane mechanics, we proposed a new molecular mechanism that could be responsible for
maintaining the unique biconcave shape of the RBC. We showed that a non-uniform force distribution coupled
with membrane tension characterized the shape of a RBC. Experimental measurements of myosin motor proteins density (performed by our collaborator Professor Velia Fowler at the University of Delaware)
in the dimple and rim regions of RBCs has validated our prediction of non-uniform force distribution in a
biconcave RBC. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007890&rev=1">[Read more]</a>

<li> <b>The Beading Structure of Membrane Nanotubes </b></li>
</ul>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Membrane nanotubes are intracellular structures that can connect cells over long distances,
providing a highway for the transfer of molecules between the cells. Nanotubes are typically thin cylindrical
membranes and their shapes play an important role in regulating their functionality. For example, in disease states such as
cancer, the change in the morphology of the nanotubes to bead-like structures can lead to the failure of their
functionality. Currently, the mechanism underlying the nanotube shape transformation is a matter of debate. Based
on our mathematical framework, we suggested that the heterogeneity in the membrane properties and the local
phase separation of protein are the key parameters for regulating the shape of nanotubes. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59221-x)">[Read more]</a>
  
 <ul>
<li> <b>Extract Forces from Shape of Cell Membranes </b></li>
</ul>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
We proposed a general analytical approach that enables us to extract the forces and predict the underlying curvature generating machinery from the shape of
the membrane alone. Particularly, we can estimate the magnitude of the effective line tension at the protein
interface based on the morphology and the composition of the membrane, while experimentally measuring line
tension is still challenging. <a href="https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E18-02-0087)">[Read more]</a>

  <ul>
<li> <b>Other Projects </b></li>
</ul>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In collaboration with Professor Jeanne Stachowiak at the University of Texas at Austin, we showed how phase separation of proteins
  at the membrane surface can drive membrane bending by the formation of protein-lined membrane tubules <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109751v1.full.pdf+html">[Read more]</a>.
  I am also working on the role of membrane-actin interactions in characterizing different shapes of dendritic spines.
  
<h2>Blood Flow in Stenosed Arteries</h2>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 

Atherosclerosis is a fatal disease in which plaques, mostly made up of fat and cholesterol, build up inside our blood vessels. 
  The plaques formed this way may grow with time to such an extent that they can significantly obstruct
our arteries. Additionally, plaques are naturally vulnerable to rupture due to the induced shear stress 
  by the blood flow. The rupture of plaque can block the vessels causing cardiac arrest and stroke under 
  severe conditions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, every year, over 10 million 
  people are losing their lives because of a heart attack all over the world.  
  <ul>
<li> <b> Application of External Magnetic Fields </b></li>
</ul>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In the last few decades,  the use of external magnetic fields has become popular as a safe treatment to control the kinematics
and the dynamics of blood flow particularly in the stenosed arteries. In order to understand how the imposed magnetic field
can alter the behavior of blood flow near atherosclerotic plaques, we developed a general code using the finite volume method (FVM) 
based on the pseudo-transient SIMPLE algorithm. Based on our results, a bi-directional magnetic field can suppress vortex formation 
and lower the wall shear stress distributions in the rear side of the plaque which can remarkably decrease the chance of plaque rupture and consequently heart attack.

  <ul>
<li> <b> Porosity of Blood Vessels </b></li>
</ul>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  
In addition to atherosclerotic plaques, it is physiologically accepted that the whole volume of blood vessels is a porous medium that its permeability changes over time. 
  To understand what would be the effect of the porosity of the lumen on the arteriosclerosis phenomenon, we developed a general code using the 
  finite volume method (FVM) assuming that the resistance offered by the porous medium obeys the Darcy's law. Also, to consider the Non-newtonian 
  rheological behavior of the blood, we used the Casson model treating the blood as a shear-thinning fluid. 
  Our numerical results indicate that both the porosity of the blood vessel and the fluid's yield stress play important roles in regulating the magnitude of induced shear stress,
  pressure drop, and the vortex formation at the rear side of the plaque. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13367-016-0012-9">[Read more]</a>

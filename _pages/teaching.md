<b>The Meaning of Life Is to Find Your Gift. The Purpose of Life Is to Give It Away</b> (Pablo Picasso)

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Teaching is a combination of both art and scienece. Teachers frame ideas, inspire innovations, and
  
  I belive teaching adds to the clarity of thought, whichis not only an essential element to one’s research endeavor, but also an indispensable element for providing occa-sions to closely interact with students and engaging them in searching for creative solutions. That being said, Ibelieve that academic teaching is a challenging endeavor, but it is of paramount importance to shape the futureof the world
  
  n instinctual art and science, an joy of learning and innovating ideas..
Many statements discuss the incorporation of philosophies such as embracing growth mindsets while teaching.
While these ideas are theoretically and conceptually great, the actual implementation and details are paramount.
I believe that a powerful framework for creating a growth mindset and positive learning environment in STEM is to <b>"teach science like we do science"</b>.
Using this framework I seek to empower others to become intellectuals (broadly defined, in this case, as those who love to creatively play with ideas) as well as teachers.

I have been fortunate to experience the joy of teaching as a graduate student.  In spring 2019, I was chosen to be a TA for “Continuum Mechanics Applied to Medicine/Biology (MAE/BENG 209)” which is an interdisciplinary course between the mechanical and bioengineering departments at UC San Diego. At the end of the course, I was honored to be strongly <b> recommended by 100% of students </b> as a TA with comments like: <i>“ Haleh’s knowledge in the subject is extensive, she truly never had a problem explaining or helping me understand. I am not sure if I would have passed the class without her. She went out of her way to make sure I comprehended the material not just completing the assignment” </i>.  In winter 2019, I was chosen as the head TA for “Thermodynamics (MAE 11)” at UC San Diego. MAE 11 is a basic undergraduate course and we have more than 200 students. At the end of the course, I was honored to be strongly recommended by 86% of students as a TA.

As a female in engineering, I personally have experienced the important role that advocacy can play in the career trajectories of undergraduate and minority students. I believe it is my turn to support underrepresented students. During my PhD., I have volunteered in multiple programs that aim to increase undergraduate and minority research in engineering. In particular, I was a mentor for the ENLACE program which provides research experiences for Latino students. I have also volunteered to mentor students for the
JUMP program that tries to provide mentorship opportunities for undergraduate and minority students at UC San Diego. I am also an active member of the MAE Graduate Women’s Group, which not only advocates for students in higher education but also provides math tutoring Math Open House for undergraduate students.

This approach also helps prevent students from forming the demoralizing impression that their teachers are better or smarter than they are.
When working on unsolved problems, the teacher and student are alike in not knowing the solution.
The major difference between them is simply experience.
Given the magnitude of modern scientific challenges, individuals can rarely singlehandedly surmount a problem, therefore the students and I work together to build teams with complementary skill sets.
As individuals interact with new team members, they discover the importance of teaching and communication in collaborations.
They find that by empowering others with knowledge, not only does the team become stronger but the time to solution is often reduced.

By teaching science like we do science I provide students a healthy environment to play, experiment, succeed, and also fail.
<b>Research and teaching can go hand-in-hand since the stronger my research program the better training my team receives.</b>
Overall, I wish to share my joy of solving the unsolved in the hopes that others are motivated to incorporate this practice into their lives and become leaders to inspire the next generation.

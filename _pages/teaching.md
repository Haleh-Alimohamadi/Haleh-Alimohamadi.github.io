<b>The Meaning of Life Is to Find Your Gift. The Purpose of Life Is to Give It Away</b> (Pablo Picasso)

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Teaching is a combination of both art and scienece. Teachers frame ideas, inspire innovations, flourish imagnigation, and train the leaders of tomorrow who can change the future of the world. In my opinion, the most important part of teaching is to awaken tht natural curiosity of young minds to see, feel, and learn every day. Like a spark of fire, sucsseful teachers initiate the learning process, rise big questions, and then get out of the way to allow students to search and find their own creative solutions. To me teaching adds to the clarity of thought; I learn something and then I understand and retain what I have learned by teaching it to someone else. Organizing my thought, intergrate it with what I already know, and then answering questions through teaching an object are joyful challenges that help me to build a deeper and long-lasting understanding.

I have been fortunate to experience the joy of teaching as a graduate student.  In spring 2019, I was chosen to be a TA for “Continuum Mechanics Applied to Medicine/Biology (MAE/BENG 209)” which is an interdisciplinary course between the mechanical and bioengineering departments at UC San Diego. At the end of the course, I was honored to be strongly <b> recommended by 100% of students </b> as a TA with comments like: <i>“ Haleh’s knowledge in the subject is extensive, she truly never had a problem explaining or helping me understand. I am not sure if I would have passed the class without her. She went out of her way to make sure I comprehended the material not just completing the assignment” </i>.  In winter 2019, I was chosen as the head TA for “Thermodynamics (MAE 11)” at UC San Diego. MAE 11 is a basic undergraduate course and we have more than 200 students. At the end of the course, I was honored to be strongly recommended by 86% of students as a TA.

As a female in engineering, I personally have experienced the important role that advocacy can play in the career trajectories of undergraduate and minority students. I believe it is my turn to support underrepresented students. During my PhD., I have volunteered in multiple programs that aim to increase undergraduate and minority research in engineering. In particular, I have participated in the ENLACE program as a mentor. ENLANCE is a bi-national summer research program that tries to encourage the participation of high school and college students in research. I have also volunteered to mentor students for the JUMP program that tries to provide mentorship opportunities for undergraduate  students at UC San Diego. I am also a member of the MAE Graduate Women’s Group at UC San Diego which not only advocates for students in higher education by organizing different seminars and workshops but also provides mentorship program and math tutoring service for undergraduate students.

Chris is a computational chemist, with experience modeling biophysical transport phenomena.
He is currently interested in the study of how systems of molecules interact in cells to form higher order functions.
This includes behaviors such as the regulation of synaptic plasticity and learning in dendritic spines.
Using his background in both computer science and chemistry, he employs and develops interdisciplinary approaches to interrogate problems of interest.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I received my M.S. and B.Sc degrees from the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Tehran, Tehran in 2014 and 2012 respectively. I a member of Laboratory for Computational and Cellular Mechanobiology under supervision of professor Padmini Rangamani. My research focuses on the application of theory of mechanics in cellular phenomena broadly from membrane -cytoskeleton interaction, membrane-protein crowding and bulk fluid to cell shape regulation, cell division and endocytosis.

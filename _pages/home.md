I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I a member of Computational and Cellular Mechanobiology Laboratory working under the supervision of Professor Padmini Rangamani. I am an engineer with training in computational biology, biophysics, and fluid mechanics.

 My research is at the interface of mathematical modeling and computational tools development to study the physical mechanisms underlying fascinating cellular phenomena. Mainly, I am interested in cell membrane mechanics to understand how molecular mechanisms can generate forces to change the geometries of cells and why cell membranes adopt distinct morphologies in response to different biophysical stimuli. In collaboration with experimentalists and biologists, I am trying to develop theoretical frameworks that closely capture the behavior of cell membranes in interactions with different curvature-generating mechanisms such as protein machinery, phase separation, and cytoskeletal forces. The results of our model can provide insight into how the failure of molecular mechanisms to maintain or alter the morphology of cell membranes can result in fatal human diseases including cancer, psychiatric disorders, neurodegeneration, and heart diseases.

<!---The cell membrane is a self-assembled lipid bilayer that serves as a semipermeable barrier

Cell shape maintenance and the ability of the cell to alter its shape are fundemental for regulation of various biological function.

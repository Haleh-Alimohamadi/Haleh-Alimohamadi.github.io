I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I a member of 
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani">Computational and Cellular Mechanobiology Laboratory</a>
  working under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani/group/padmini-rangamani?authuser=0">Professor Padmini Rangamani</a>
  . I am an engineer with training in computational biology, biophysics, and fluid mechanics.

My research is at the interface of mathematical modeling and computational tools development to study the physical mechanisms underlying fascinating cellular phenomena. 
  Mainly, I am interested in cell membrane mechanics to understand how molecular mechanisms can generate forces to change the shape of cells. 
  In collaboration with experimentalists and biologists, I am trying to develop theoretical frameworks that closely capture the behavior of cell membranes 
  in interactions with different curvature-generating mechanisms. The results of our model can provide insight into how the failure of molecular mechanisms 
  in maintaining or altering the morphology of cell membranes can result in fatal human diseases including cancer, psychiatric disorders, neurodegeneration, and 
  heart diseases. I am also interested in fluid mechanics particularly biofluid. In my master's studies, I have developed general codes to study the kinematics 
  and the dynamics of blood flow in porous vessels and under the action of external magnetic fields. Considering the role of surrounding bulk fluid on adjusting 
  the shape of cell membranes, I am passionate to incorporate my knowledge to study the cell membrane behavior in a fluid flow.

As a graduate student, I have received prestigious awards including Siebel Scholarship, MAE Distinguished Ph.D. Student Fellowship, Visible Molecular Cell Consortium (VMCC) and the Center 
  for Trans-scale Structural Biology and Biophysics (CTSBB) Fellowship,
  and MAE Outstanding Graduate Student Award. I was also honored to be recognized as 2019 Rising Stars in Mechanical Engineering by Stanford University. 
  During my PhD., I have volunteered in multiple programs that aim to increase undergraduate and minority research in engineering. In particular, 
  I have participated in <a href="https://summer.ucsd.edu/program-finder/enlace.html">ENLACE</a> and
  <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/programs/jump.shtml">JUMP</a> programs as a mentor. I am also a member of 
  the <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/mae-graduate-women/home?authuser=0">MAE Graduate Womenâ€™s Group</a> and tutoring in

<!---and why cell membranes adopt distinct morphologies in response to different biophysical stimuli
The cell membrane is a self-assembled lipid bilayer that serves as a semipermeable barrier
and protects the cell's contents from perils in the extracellular. From a mechanical point of view, the cell membrane is a continuous viscoelastic shell that facilitates the change of the cell morphology--->

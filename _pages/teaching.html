<b>The Meaning of Life Is to Find Your Gift. The Purpose of Life Is to Give It Away</b> (Pablo Picasso)

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Teaching is a combination of both art and science. Teachers frame ideas, inspire innovations, flourish imagination, 
  and train the leaders of tomorrow who can change the future of the world. In my opinion, the most important part of 
  teaching is to awaken the natural curiosity of young minds to see, feel, and learn every day. Like a spark of fire, 
  successful teachers initiate the learning process, rise big questions, and then get out of the way to allow students
  to search and find their own solutions. To me teaching adds to the clarity of thought; I learn something and then 
  I understand and retain what I have learned by teaching it to someone else. Organizing my thought, integrate it with 
  what I already know, and then answering questions through teaching are joyful challenges that help me to build a deeper 
  and long-lasting understanding.

I have been fortunate to experience the joy of teaching as a graduate student.  In spring 2019, I was chosen to be a 
  Teaching Assistant (TA) for "Continuum Mechanics Applied to Medicine/Biology (MAE/BENG 209)" which is an interdisciplinary 
  course between the mechanical and bioengineering departments at UC San Diego. At the end of the course, 
  I was honored to be strongly <b> recommended by 100% of students </b> as a TA with comments like: <i> "Haleh’s knowledge in the subject is extensive,
  she truly never had a problem explaining or helping me understand. I am not sure if I would have passed the class without her. 
  She went out of her way to make sure I comprehended the material not just completing the assignment" </i>.  
  In winter 2019 and 2021, I was chosen as the head TA for "Thermodynamics (MAE 11)" at UC San Diego. MAE 11 is a basic undergraduate 
  course and we have about 200 students. At the end of both quarters, students strongly recommended (100%) me as a TA.

As a woman in engineering, I personally have experienced the important role that advocacy can play in the career trajectories of
  undergraduate and minority students. I believe it is my turn to support underrepresented students. During my PhD., I have volunteered in 
  multiple programs that aim to increase undergraduate and minority research in engineering. In particular, I have participated in 
  the <a href="https://summer.ucsd.edu/program-finder/enlace.html">ENLACE</a> program as a mentor. ENLANCE is a bi-national summer
  research program that tries to encourage the participation of high school and college students in research. 
  I have also volunteered to mentor students for the <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/programs/jump.shtml">JUMP</a> program that 
  tries to provide mentorship opportunities for undergraduate  students at UC San Diego. I am also a member of the
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/mae-graduate-women/home?authuser=0">MAE Graduate Women’s Group</a> at UC San Diego which not only 
  advocates for students in higher education by organizing different seminars and workshops but also provides mentorship program and 
  math tutoring (<a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/mae-graduate-women/math-open-house?authuser=0">Math Open House</a>) service 
  for undergraduate students.

In this perspective, we examine three key aspects of an end-to-end pipeline for realistic cellular simulations: reconstruction and segmentation of cellular structures; generation of cellular structures; and mesh generation, simulation, and data analysis.  We highlight some of the relevant prior work in these distinct but overlapping areas, with a particular emphasis on current use of machine learning technologies, as well as on future opportunities.
